This repo contains 3 datasets :
> df (W_OMATraitement.csv file) : stands for source "treatment dataset"
> dfcol (W_OMACOllecte.csv file) : stands for source "collect dataset"
> dfmerged (W_df_merged.csv file) : stands for the merged dataset

I made this merge in order to get ratios of waste quantities / areas inhabitants, and be able to better compare datas between each others.
In consequence, this repo also contains 3 notebooks :
> W_notebook_OMATraitement.ipynb : stands for df EDA
> W_notebook_OMACollect.ipynb : stands for dfcol EDA
> W_merge.ipynb : dfmerged
>
